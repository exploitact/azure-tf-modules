1. Fail Faster And Cheaper - automate the build process. Your build process should involve version control and issue tracking. It should also integrate and run unit tests, so that builds fail for code that does not meet functional requirements
2. Commit Daily - it's debatable but delaying commits and merging ensures future problems. 
3. Fix The Broken Builds - ensuring that your build and test process is available and visible.
4. Continuously Automate The Delivery Lifecycle - keep improving your CI/CD pipeline and your processes.
